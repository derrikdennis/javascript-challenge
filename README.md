## Background

In this exercise, I am working for `ALIENS-R-REAL`, a non-profit dedicated to getting the truth out there based on information collected from eye-witness reports.

There's a bit of a problem: the collection of data is too large to search through manually.  It needs to be put into a table that can be searched through.

The assignment for this week is to write code that is based on a [dataset](/static/js/data.js).  There needs to be a filter for specific values.  

There's a catch though - it can only be done using d3.js, JavaScript, CSS and HTML.  The instructions of what to do are found below.

## Your Task

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

* HTML and CSS pages were provided.  I was allowed to create my own page, but chose to focus on the JavaScript and DOM manipulation for the assignment.

* Using the dataset provided, I wrote code that appended information to a table based on the the information used to filer.
  
  * This table had columns for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

* Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
